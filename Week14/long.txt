 I'm not wearing hockey pads. It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me. Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area. Swear to me!

 Swear to me! Does it come in black? I'm Batman Swear to me! It was a dog. It was a big dog.

 It's ends here. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. It was a dog. It was a big dog.

 No guns, no killing. This isn't a car. I'm Batman Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. No guns, no killing. Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages. I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham.
